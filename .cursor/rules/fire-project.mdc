# FIRE Project Development Standards

## File Organization
- All planning documents should be stored in the `plans/` directory
- Planning documents should follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH:MM_description.md`
- Implementation files should be stored in appropriate feature directories

## Code Style
- Use Google Apps Script style guide for JavaScript code
- Include JSDoc comments for all functions
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use meaningful variable names that reflect financial context. Prefer longer, more exact names over brevity.

## Documentation
- All major features should have a corresponding plan document
- Plans should include:
  - Architecture overview
  - Technical components
  - Implementation steps
  - Timeline
  - Security considerations
  - Maintenance notes
- Plans should have steps.
- Steps should be marked as completed when they have been completed.

## Git Workflow
- Commit messages should be clear and descriptive
- Each feature should be developed in its own branch
- Plans should be committed before implementation begins
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Commit regularly, silentyly, each time you update files

## Human Workflow
- When there are steps to be taken outside of the repository, it is acceptable to ask me to do them and confirm once they are done
- Refer to me by using imaginative motivational names

## Testing
- Include test cases in plan documents
- Test with real transaction data
- Document edge cases and how they're handled

## Security
- Store API keys in Google Apps Script Properties Service
- Document any security considerations in plan files
- Include error handling for API calls

## Maintenance
- Document any manual steps required
- Include setup instructions in plan documents
- Note any dependencies or prerequisites
