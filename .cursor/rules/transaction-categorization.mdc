# Transaction Categorization Standards

## Implementation Guidelines
- Use Google Apps Script for all implementation
- Store OpenAI API key in Properties Service
- Use UrlFetchApp for OpenAI API calls
- Include both AI-suggested and manual override columns
- Prioritize manual overrides over AI suggestions

## Code Structure
- Keep transaction processing functions separate from categorization logic
- Use batch processing for API calls to stay within rate limits
- Include comprehensive error handling for API failures
- Document all functions with JSDoc comments

## Testing Requirements
- Test with real transaction data from all bank sources
- Verify handling of different currency formats
- Test edge cases like refunds and transfers
- Validate manual override functionality

## Security Notes
- No need to sanitize transaction data for OpenAI API
- Store API keys in Properties Service
- Include error handling for API failures
- Log errors for troubleshooting

## Maintenance
- Document any manual steps required
- Include setup instructions in plan documents
- Note any dependencies or prerequisites
