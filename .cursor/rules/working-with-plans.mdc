When I ask you to make a plan, only make the plan. Do not execute the plan until I tell you to.

All new or active planning documents should be stored in the `docs/plans/active` directory

Planning documents should follow the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-hh-mm_description.md`, calculating today's date and time when creating a new file `timestamp=$(date "+%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M")`

Plans should have a single set of checklist items that can be ticked. They can be grouped into related items.

Plans should have the following sections: Problem Statement, Related ADRs (typically only 1 to 2 refrenced), Implementation Steps (Checklist), Test Cases, Lessons Learned

Lessons Learned section should begin empty, and as we work together you should update it whenever we struggle on something for a while and find a solution

Every plan should have a final step to review the plan and re-assess the codebase to understand whether everything has actuall now been completed. If not, gaps should be added to the plan.

Once a reassessment finishes and there are no outstnading changes, you should ask whether we are complete. If we are, then you should move the plan to `docs/plans/completed/`
