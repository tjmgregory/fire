If you choose to diverge from any documented decisions (e.g., documentation, ADRs, plans, READMEs, etc.), you must first update the relevant documents to reflect this change. This ensures the documentation always represents the most current thinking before any action is taken.

When I ask you to make a plan, only make the plan. Do not execute the plan until I tell you to.

Plans should have steps in a checklist form that can be ticked.

Every plan should have a final step to review the plan and re-assess the codebase to understand whether everything has actuall now been completed. If not, gaps should be added to the plan.

Once a reassessment finishes and there are no outstnading changes, you should ask whether we are complete. If we are, then you should move the plan to docs/plans/completed/
