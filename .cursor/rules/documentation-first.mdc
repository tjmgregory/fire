If you choose to diverge from any documented decisions (e.g., documentation, ADRs, plans, READMEs, etc.), you must first update the relevant documents to reflect this change. This ensures the documentation always represents the most current thinking before any action is taken.

When I ask you to make a plan, do not execute the plan until we have confirmed together that it is the right plan to take.

Plans should have steps in a checklist form that can be ticked.

Every plan shoudl have a final step to review the plan and re-assess the codebase to understnad whether everything has actuall now been completed. If not, gaps should be added to the plan.

Once a reassessment finishes and there are no outstnading changes, you should ask whether we are complete. If we are, then you should move the plan to docs/plans/completed/
