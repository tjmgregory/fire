# Logging and Error Handling Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview
This plan implements the logging and error handling strategy defined in ADR 006. The current implementation has several issues:

1. Duplicate logging - Both `console.error` and `utils.logError` are often called together
2. Error propagation - Errors are thrown after logging, potentially causing script termination
3. Inconsistent error handling patterns - Some functions have try/catch blocks, others throw directly
4. Validation logic often uses unnecessary else clauses
5. No standardized approach to general application logging
6. Lack of log levels for differentiating information types

## Technical Components
1. **Console-based Logging**: 
   - Use native console methods with appropriate severity levels
   - Add structured context information to console messages
   - Ensure useful information at each log level:
     - `console.error()` - Report errors with stack traces
     - `console.warn()` - Flag potential issues
     - `console.info()` - Track main program flow
     - `console.debug()` - Provide detailed execution information

2. **Execution Log Sheet**:
   - Simple execution tracking in a spreadsheet
   - Record start, completion, and errors for major operations
   - Include timestamp, function name, status, and brief details
   - Keep as a high-level audit trail

3. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Create detailed, contextual error messages
   - Implement guard clauses for early validation
   - Allow errors to propagate naturally to entry points
   - Catch and handle errors only at top-level entry points

## Implementation Steps

1. [x] Document logging and error handling approach in ADR 006
   - [x] Define logging and error handling requirements
   - [x] Outline technical components
   - [x] Document consequences and implementation notes

2. [ ] Implement Execution Log Mechanism
   - [ ] Create ExecutionLog sheet
   - [ ] Implement logExecutionSummary function
   - [ ] Add headers and formatting
   - [ ] Include functions for logging start/success/error

3. [ ] Update main.gs to use proper error handling
   - [ ] Add appropriate console logging statements
   - [ ] Use execution log for major operations
   - [ ] Implement guard clauses for validation
   - [ ] Add top-level error handling in entry point functions

4. [ ] Update utils.gs to use proper error handling
   - [ ] Replace logError method with direct console.error calls
   - [ ] Add context to error messages
   - [ ] Refactor validation logic to use guard clauses
   - [ ] Ensure error propagation to caller functions

5. [ ] Create examples and documentation
   - [ ] Add examples for proper logging usage
   - [ ] Document error handling best practices
   - [ ] Create guidelines for error message content
   - [ ] Include log level usage guidelines

## Timeline
- Implementation of core components: 0.5 day
- Code refactoring of existing codebase: 1 day
- Testing: 0.5 day
- Documentation: 0.5 day

## Security Considerations
- Ensure no sensitive data is included in logs
- Consider what execution details are appropriate for the log sheet
- Be careful not to expose implementation details in error messages
- Add ability to redact sensitive information from logs

## Maintenance Notes
- Review logs periodically to identify common issues
- Perform regular log rotation of execution logs
- Consider adding filtering capabilities for execution logs
- Add error aggregation for common issues

## Test Cases
1. Function throws error with stack trace
   - Call a function that deliberately throws an error 
   - Verify the error is logged with stack trace to console
   - Verify the execution log records the failure

2. Function validation works with guard clauses
   - Call a function with invalid parameters
   - Verify the error explains the validation issue
   - Verify the error contains useful context

3. Top-level error handling prevents termination
   - Cause an error in a deeply nested function call
   - Verify the error propagates to the entry point
   - Verify the script continues to run after error handling

4. Console logging provides appropriate detail levels
   - Check that debug messages include sufficient detail
   - Verify info messages track main program flow
   - Confirm error messages include stack traces
   
5. Execution log provides useful audit trail
   - Verify start and end of major operations are recorded
   - Confirm errors are recorded with sufficient context
   - Check that execution log doesn't grow excessively large

## Edge Cases
1. Very large stack traces in the console
   - Test with deeply nested function calls
   - Verify stack traces remain useful

2. High volume of log messages
   - Test with large data processing operations
   - Ensure performance isn't significantly impacted

3. Multiple errors in sequence
   - Create a situation with multiple errors
   - Verify all errors are logged appropriately
   - Check that execution log captures the key issues
