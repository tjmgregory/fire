# Logging and Error Handling Implementation Plan

## Architecture Overview
This plan implements the logging and error handling strategy defined in the coding standards document. The current implementation has several issues:

1. Duplicate logging - Both `console.error` and `utils.logError` are often called together
2. Error propagation - Errors are thrown after logging, potentially causing script termination
3. Inconsistent error handling patterns - Some functions have try/catch blocks, others throw directly
4. Validation logic often uses unnecessary else clauses
5. No standardized approach to general application logging
6. Lack of log levels for differentiating information types

## Technical Components
1. **Console-based Logging**: 
   - Use native console methods with appropriate severity levels
   - Add structured context information to console messages
   - Ensure useful information at each log level:
     - `console.error()` - Report errors with stack traces
     - `console.warn()` - Flag potential issues
     - `console.info()` - Track main program flow
     - `console.log()` - Provide detailed execution information

2. **Error Handling Improvements**:
   - Create detailed, contextual error messages
   - Implement guard clauses for early validation
   - Allow errors to propagate naturally to entry points
   - Only catch errors when they can be meaningfully handled
   - Never catch an error just to log and rethrow it
   - Log errors only at the point where they are handled
   - Keep try/catch blocks focused only on specific operations that need special error handling

## Implementation Steps

   - [x] Outline technical components
   - [x] Document consequences and implementation notes

2. [x] Update main.gs to use proper error handling
   - [x] Add appropriate console logging statements for normal flow
   - [x] Implement guard clauses for validation (throw without logging)
   - [x] Add top-level error handling in entry point functions
   - [x] Ensure errors are only logged where they are caught
   - [x] Use consistent function naming and structure
   - [x] Keep try/catch blocks minimal and focused

3. [x] Update utils.gs to use proper error handling
   - [x] Replace logError method with proper error handling
   - [x] Add context to error messages
   - [x] Refactor validation logic to use guard clauses
   - [x] Remove any instances of logging and then throwing
   - [x] Ensure error propagation to caller functions
   - [x] Minimize and focus the scope of try/catch blocks

4. [x] Update config.gs to use proper error handling
   - [x] Add guard clauses for required parameters
   - [x] Use appropriate log levels (info, debug)
   - [x] Add context to error messages
   - [x] Let errors propagate naturally
   - [x] Remove duplicate logging
   - [x] Add validation for spreadsheet access

- Implementation of core components: 0.5 day
- Code refactoring of existing codebase: 1 day
- Testing: 0.5 day
- Documentation: 0.5 day

## Security Considerations
- Ensure no sensitive data is included in logs
- Be careful not to expose implementation details in error messages
- Add ability to redact sensitive information from logs

## Maintenance Notes
- Review logs periodically to identify common issues
- Consider adding monitoring in production environments
- Ensure logs are reviewed during issue investigation

## Test Cases
1. Function throws error with stack trace
   - Call a function that throws an error without logging it
   - Verify the error propagates naturally through the call stack
   - Verify the error is logged only at the point where it's handled
   - Verify no intermediate catch-and-rethrow occurs

2. Function validation works with guard clauses
   - Call a function with invalid parameters
   - Verify the error explains the validation issue
   - Verify the error contains useful context
   - Verify errors propagate without intermediate catching

3. Top-level error handling prevents termination
   - Cause an error in a deeply nested function call
   - Verify the error propagates naturally to the entry point
   - Verify the error is logged only at the entry point
   - Verify the script continues to run after error handling

4. Console logging provides appropriate detail levels
   - Check that debug messages include sufficient detail
   - Verify info messages track main program flow
   - Confirm error messages include stack traces
   - Verify no duplicate logging occurs

5. Focused try/catch blocks
   - Verify try/catch blocks only wrap specific error-prone operations
   - Check that normal validation occurs outside the try/catch blocks
   - Confirm that errors are converted to more meaningful ones when caught
   - Verify no catch-and-rethrow patterns exist

## Edge Cases
1. Very large stack traces in the console
   - Test with deeply nested function calls
   - Verify stack traces remain useful

2. High volume of log messages
   - Test with large data processing operations
   - Ensure performance isn't significantly impacted

3. Multiple errors in sequence
   - Create a situation with multiple errors
   - Verify all errors are logged appropriately
   - Verify no duplicate logging occurs
