# ADR 004: Trigger System Design

## Status

Proposed

## Context

We need an automated system to:
- Process new transactions
- Update categorizations
- Generate summaries
- Handle errors
- Maintain data consistency

## Decision

We will implement a trigger-based system with the following components:

1. **Time-Based Triggers**
   - Hourly check for new transactions
   - Daily summary generation
   - Weekly cleanup and optimization
   - Monthly report generation

2. **Event-Based Triggers**
   - On sheet edit (for manual overrides)
   - On new sheet addition
   - On error detection
   - On API rate limit approach

3. **Error Handling**
   - Automatic retry for transient failures
   - Error logging and notification
   - Fallback mechanisms
   - State recovery

4. **State Management**
   - Track last processed transaction
   - Monitor API usage
   - Track manual overrides
   - Maintain processing history

## Consequences

### Positive
- Automated processing
- Reliable error handling
- Efficient resource usage
- Maintainable system

### Negative
- Complex trigger management
- Need to handle edge cases
- Potential for race conditions
- More complex testing

## Implementation Notes

1. Implement trigger cleanup on initialization
2. Add trigger monitoring
3. Create error recovery system
4. Set up notification system
5. Add trigger logging
