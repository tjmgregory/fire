# ADR 006: Error Handling and Logging Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our current logging and error handling approach has several issues:
1. Duplicate logging - Both `console.error` and `utils.logError` are often called together
2. Error propagation - Errors are thrown after logging, causing script termination
3. Inconsistent error handling patterns - Some functions have try/catch blocks, others throw directly
4. Validation logic often uses unnecessary else clauses
5. No standardized approach to general application logging
6. Lack of log levels for differentiating information types

These issues make the codebase harder to maintain and debug, while potentially causing unexpected termination of scripts and making it difficult to trace program execution.

## Decision

We will implement a centralized logging and error handling system with the following components:

1. **Unified Logger Class**
   - Handles both error and general application logging
   - Logs all errors with stack traces
   - Supports different severity levels (FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)
   - Allows for controlled error propagation
   - Provides context-aware reporting
   - Standardizes log format and storage

2. **Guard Clause Pattern**
   - Early returns from functions when validation fails
   - Use assertion utilities that don't require else branches
   - Validate inputs at function entry points

3. **Consistent Error Handling**
   - Errors should be logged but not allowed to terminate program flow unless explicitly intended
   - All error logs must include stack traces
   - Error context should be captured when available
   - Standardized approach across the codebase

4. **Validation Utilities**
   - Type checking helpers
   - Null/undefined checking
   - Format validation for common data types
   - Chain-able validation API

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better error traceability with consistent stack traces
- Reduced likelihood of unexpected script termination
- Cleaner code without unnecessary else clauses
- Centralized logging for easier debugging and application monitoring
- Ability to categorize messages by severity
- Improved context for faster issue resolution
- Better visibility into application flow and state

### Negative
- Need to refactor existing code to use the new pattern
- Small learning curve for new logging approach
- Slight increase in code complexity with additional class

### Neutral
- Different logging approach than standard Google Apps Script practices
- Added indirection through Logger class
- Potential increase in log storage requirements

## Implementation Notes

1. Create a dedicated Logger class with error handling capabilities
2. Modify Utils class to use Logger
3. Create validation utilities
4. Update existing code to use new logging pattern
5. Add tests for logging and error handling scenarios
6. Document logging and error handling best practices
