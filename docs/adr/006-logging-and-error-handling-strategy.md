# ADR 006: Error Handling and Logging Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Our current logging and error handling approach has several issues:
1. Duplicate logging - Both `console.error` and `utils.logError` are often called together
2. Error propagation - Errors are thrown after logging, potentially causing script termination
3. Inconsistent error handling patterns - Some functions have try/catch blocks, others throw directly
4. Validation logic often uses unnecessary else clauses
5. No standardized approach to general application logging
6. Lack of log levels for differentiating information types

These issues make the codebase harder to maintain and debug, while potentially causing unexpected termination of scripts and making it difficult to trace program execution.

## Decision

We will implement a centralized logging and error handling system with the following architectural components:

1. **Console-based Logging System**
   - Replace sheet-based logging with native console methods
   - Implement a structured logging approach with severity levels
   - Ensure all errors include stack traces
   - Keep detailed logs in the console for debugging

2. **Error Handling Architecture**
   - Implement a consistent error propagation pattern
   - Use guard clauses for validation
   - Centralize error handling at entry points
   - Allow errors to propagate naturally through the call stack

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better error traceability with consistent stack traces
- Reduced likelihood of unexpected script termination
- Cleaner code without unnecessary else clauses
- Improved visibility into application flow with appropriate severity levels
- Simpler logging implementation
- No duplicate logging of the same error
- Focused, minimal try/catch blocks

### Negative
- Need to refactor existing code to use the new pattern
- Small learning curve for new logging approach

### Neutral
- Some loss of log persistence compared to sheet-based logging
- Potential need for additional monitoring in production environments
