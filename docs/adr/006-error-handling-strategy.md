# ADR 006: Error Handling Strategy

## Status

Proposed

## Context

Our current error handling approach has several issues:
1. Duplicate logging - Both `console.error` and `utils.logError` are often called together
2. Error propagation - Errors are thrown after logging, causing script termination
3. Inconsistent error handling patterns - Some functions have try/catch blocks, others throw directly
4. Validation logic often uses unnecessary else clauses

These issues make the codebase harder to maintain and debug, while potentially causing unexpected termination of scripts.

## Decision

We will implement a centralized error handling system with the following components:

1. **ErrorHandler Class**
   - Logs all errors with stack traces
   - Supports different severity levels (FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG)
   - Allows for controlled error propagation
   - Provides context-aware error reporting

2. **Guard Clause Pattern**
   - Early returns from functions when validation fails
   - Use assertion utilities that don't require else branches
   - Validate inputs at function entry points

3. **Consistent Error Handling**
   - Errors should be logged but not allowed to terminate program flow unless explicitly intended
   - All error logs must include stack traces
   - Error context should be captured when available
   - Standardized approach across the codebase

4. **Validation Utilities**
   - Type checking helpers
   - Null/undefined checking
   - Format validation for common data types
   - Chain-able validation API

## Consequences

### Positive
- Better error traceability with consistent stack traces
- Reduced likelihood of unexpected script termination
- Cleaner code without unnecessary else clauses
- Centralized error logging for easier debugging
- Ability to categorize errors by severity
- Improved error context for faster issue resolution

### Negative
- Need to refactor existing code to use the new pattern
- Small learning curve for new error handling approach
- Slight increase in code complexity with additional class

### Neutral
- Different error handling approach than standard Google Apps Script practices
- Added indirection through ErrorHandler class

## Implementation Notes

1. Create a dedicated ErrorHandler class
2. Modify Utils class to use ErrorHandler
3. Create validation utilities
4. Update existing code to use new pattern
5. Add tests for error handling scenarios
6. Document error handling best practices
