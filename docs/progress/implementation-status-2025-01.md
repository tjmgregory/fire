# FIRE Project Implementation Status Report
*Generated: January 2025*

## Executive Summary

The FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) project is a Google Apps Script-based system for automated transaction categorization across multiple bank accounts. This report analyzes the current implementation against the planned architecture defined in the Architecture Decision Records (ADRs).

**Overall Status**: ~40% Complete - Core functionality partially working but missing critical production features.

## Implementation Progress by ADR

### ADR 001: Data Normalization Strategy
**Status**: 70% Complete

#### ✅ Implemented
- Column mapping system for Monzo, Revolut, and Yonder
- Transaction ID generation using `Utilities.getUuid()`
- Original reference generation for duplicate detection
- Date normalization to ISO format (UTC)
- Amount normalization (negative for debits)
- Transaction type normalization (PAYMENT, TRANSFER, ATM)
- Basic currency conversion to GBP (hardcoded rates)
- Description normalization with bank-specific field combination strategies
- Stable reference generation without amounts (avoiding exchange rate issues)

#### ❌ Missing
- Real-time exchange rate API integration
- Proper metadata storage for original currency/amount
- Category split information preservation

### ADR 002: Transaction Categorization Strategy
**Status**: 60% Complete

#### ✅ Implemented
- OpenAI GPT-4 integration for categorization
- Batch processing (10 transactions per batch)
- Confidence scores
- JSON response format enforcement
- Rate limiting (1 second delay between batches)
- Error handling for failed categorization

#### ❌ Missing
- Manual override functionality (column exists but no UI/trigger)
- Learning mechanism from manual corrections
- Caching system for API responses
- Transaction history context (last 5 similar transactions)
- Categorization accuracy tracking
- Periodic retraining based on manual corrections

### ADR 003: Output Sheet Structure
**Status**: 30% Complete

#### ✅ Implemented
- Main transaction sheet with all specified columns
- Processing status tracking (UNPROCESSED, CATEGORIZED, ERROR)
- Timestamp tracking for normalization and categorization
- Error details column

#### ❌ Missing
- Category column formula (should use AI Category unless Manual Override exists)
- Monthly Summary Sheet (auto-generated summaries)
- System Logs Sheet (error tracking, API usage)
- Category Definitions Sheet
- Data validation rules
- Sheet protection

### ADR 004: Trigger System Design
**Status**: 10% Complete

#### ✅ Implemented
- OnEdit triggers created (functionality questionable)
- Basic trigger setup/cleanup logic

#### ❌ Missing
- Time-based triggers (all commented out):
  - Hourly categorization trigger
  - 15-minute normalization trigger
  - Daily summary generation
  - Weekly cleanup
  - Monthly report generation
- Error recovery and state management
- Trigger monitoring and cleanup
- API rate limit monitoring

### ADR 005: Normalization-Categorization Separation
**Status**: 90% Complete

#### ✅ Implemented
- Separate `processNewTransactions()` for normalization
- Separate `categorizeTransactions()` for AI categorization
- Status-based processing (only categorizes UNPROCESSED transactions)
- Clear separation of concerns in code structure

#### ❌ Missing
- More sophisticated state management between phases

## Critical Bugs

### BUG-001: Duplicate Transaction Processing
- **Priority**: High
- **Impact**: Normalization re-adds all rows from input sheets on each run
- **Root Cause**: Broken logic for checking existing transactions
- **Status**: Open

### BUG-002: Credit/Debit Normalization
- **Priority**: High
- **Impact**: All transactions assumed to be debits
- **Root Cause**: Missing logic to respect transaction type from source sheets
- **Status**: Open

## Code Quality Assessment

### Strengths
- Good error handling patterns established
- Consistent logging throughout
- Clear separation of concerns
- JSDoc comments present
- Configuration centralized in `config.gs`

### Areas for Improvement
- Hardcoded currency exchange rates
- Limited test coverage
- No state persistence mechanism
- Missing data validation

## Missing Production Features

1. **Automation**
   - All time-based triggers disabled
   - No automatic processing pipeline

2. **User Interface**
   - No manual override workflow
   - No data validation on user inputs
   - No user feedback mechanisms

3. **Monitoring & Logging**
   - No System Logs sheet
   - No API usage tracking
   - No performance metrics
   - No error alerting

4. **Data Management**
   - Broken duplicate detection
   - No backup system
   - No data retention policy
   - No cleanup mechanisms

5. **Reporting**
   - No monthly summaries
   - No trend analysis
   - No budget comparisons
   - No category analytics

## Recommendations for Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Fix Critical Issues)
1. Fix BUG-001: Implement proper duplicate detection using originalReference
2. Fix BUG-002: Add credit/debit transaction handling
3. Enable basic time-based triggers for automated processing

### Short-term Goals (Core Functionality)
1. Implement System Logs sheet for monitoring
2. Add manual override functionality
3. Create Monthly Summary sheet
4. Add real exchange rate API integration

### Medium-term Goals (Production Readiness)
1. Implement learning mechanism from manual corrections
2. Add comprehensive error recovery
3. Create backup and restore functionality
4. Add data validation rules

### Long-term Goals (Enhanced Features)
1. Implement transaction history context for better categorization
2. Add budget comparison features
3. Create advanced analytics and reporting
4. Build user-friendly configuration interface

## Technical Debt

1. **Hardcoded Values**
   - Currency exchange rates
   - API model name ('gpt-4.1-nano')
   - Batch size and rate limits

2. **Missing Abstractions**
   - No proper state management
   - No caching layer
   - No proper error recovery

3. **Testing**
   - No automated tests
   - No validation of edge cases
   - No performance testing

## Conclusion

The FIRE project has established a solid architectural foundation with clear separation of concerns and well-documented design decisions. However, significant work remains to transform this foundation into a production-ready system. The immediate focus should be on fixing critical bugs and enabling basic automation, followed by implementing the missing monitoring and user interaction features.

The codebase shows good practices in terms of structure and documentation, but needs attention to production concerns like error handling, monitoring, and automation. With focused effort on the identified priorities, the system can evolve from its current prototype state to a reliable financial automation tool.
