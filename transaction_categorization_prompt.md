# Automated Transaction Categorization System Prompt

I need help creating a plan for building an automated transaction categorization system that integrates with my Google Sheets setup. Here are the key details and requirements:

## Current Setup
- Multiple Google Sheets containing bank transaction data
  - Each sheet represents a different bank account
  - Sheets contain raw transaction data with dates, amounts, descriptions, etc.
- A separate Google Sheet for tracking FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) goals

## Requirements

### 1. Automated Transaction Processing
- System should automatically fetch and process new transactions from all bank account sheets
- Need to handle different transaction formats from various banks
- Should update in real-time or on a scheduled basis

### 2. Categorization System
- Create a flexible categorization framework that can be customized
- Categories should align with FIRE tracking needs (e.g., essential expenses, investments, savings)
- Should learn from manual corrections to improve accuracy over time

### 3. Integration Requirements
- Must work with Google Sheets API
- Should maintain data consistency across all sheets
- Need to handle multiple currencies if applicable

### 4. Output Requirements
- Categorized transactions should be easily viewable and filterable
- Should provide summary statistics and trends
- Need to generate reports that help track progress towards FIRE goals

## Please Provide
1. A high-level architecture for the system
2. Specific technical components needed
3. Step-by-step implementation plan
4. Considerations for data security and privacy
5. Potential challenges and their solutions
6. Recommendations for tools, libraries, and APIs to use
7. Estimated development timeline
8. Maintenance and scaling considerations

Please also suggest any additional features that could be valuable for FIRE tracking that I might not have considered.
