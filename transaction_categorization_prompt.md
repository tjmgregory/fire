# Automated Transaction Categorization System Prompt

I need help creating a plan for building an automated transaction categorization system that integrates with my Google Sheets setup. Here are the key details and requirements:

## Current Setup
- Multiple Google Sheets containing bank transaction data
  - Each sheet represents a different bank account
  - Sheets contain raw transaction data with dates, amounts, descriptions, etc.
  - One sheet receives live transaction updates
  - Two sheets require manual CSV imports
  - Some sheets already have existing categories, but these should be treated as suggestions rather than definitive categorizations
- A separate Google Sheet for tracking FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early) goals

## Requirements

### 1. Automated Transaction Processing
- System should automatically fetch and process new transactions from all bank account sheets
- Need to handle different transaction formats from various banks
- Should update in real-time for the live-updating sheet
- Should process CSV imports for the other two sheets
- Should update on a scheduled basis or when rows are added

### 2. Categorization System
- Must use ChatGPT 4.1 nano for all transaction categorization
- Must categorize transactions into the following predefined categories:
  - Housing
  - Subscriptions
  - Phone
  - Groceries
  - Entertainment
  - Eating Out
  - Flights
  - Insurance
  - Clothing
  - Self Care
  - Gym
  - Education
  - Medical
  - Rideshare
  - Gifts
  - Charity
  - Fees
  - Cash
  - Misc (for transactions that cannot be confidently categorized)
- Should learn from manual corrections to improve accuracy over time
- Should consider existing categories in bank sheets as suggestions only, not definitive categorizations

### 3. Integration Requirements
- Must work with Google Sheets API
- Should maintain data consistency across all sheets
- Need to handle multiple currencies if applicable
- Preferred implementation in Google Apps Script for ease of deployment and maintenance
- Alternative solutions should be simple to deploy and maintain if Apps Script is not suitable

### 4. Output Requirements
- Create a new sheet with the following structure:
  - Columns: One for each category (Housing, Subscriptions, etc.)
  - Rows: One for each month
  - Each cell should contain the total amount for that category in that month

## Please Provide
1. A high-level architecture for the system
2. Specific technical components needed
3. Step-by-step implementation plan
4. Considerations for data security and privacy
5. Potential challenges and their solutions
6. Recommendations for tools, libraries, and APIs to use
7. Estimated development timeline
8. Maintenance and scaling considerations

Please also suggest any additional features that could be valuable for FIRE tracking that I might not have considered.
